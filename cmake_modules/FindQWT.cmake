# Qt Widgets for Technical Applications
# available at http://www.http://qwt.sourceforge.net/
#
# The module defines the following variables:
#  Qwt_FOUND - the system has Qwt
#  QWT_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find qwt_plot.h
#  QWT_INCLUDE_DIRS - qwt includes
#  QWT_LIBRARY - where to find the Qwt library
#  QWT_LIBRARIES - aditional libraries
#  QWT_VERSION_STRING - version (ex. 5.2.1)
#
# It also defines this imported target:
#  Qwt::Qwt
